Dorn came in June the rattlesnakes in July
the river is low the forest dry
every morning I get up early
walking to Naked Falls to swim 
the words come slowly   
the work comes slowly  off alone  in the workmans' bunkhouse
behind my mother's place  home but doubly not home
I am here to write  to write about writing

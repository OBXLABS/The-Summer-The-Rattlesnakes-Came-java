they come and they came and they kept coming
silent slither first we'd know 
dogs bar bar barking
then the rattle a tiny engine dry starting first
just a few tchookatchookatchooka one two three and then
ztztztztztzt it's wound-up up to speed zinging along like an un-lubricated two-stroke
about to throw a piston

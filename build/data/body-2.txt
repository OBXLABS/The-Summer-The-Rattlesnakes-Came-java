The words come slowly, the work comes slowly
Off alone in the workmans' bunkhouse
behind my mother's place  at the other end
of the long long field fronting the house
of the lord of the manor home but doubly not home
Every morning's swim is double visioned
the cold of the water and the heat of rocks
and the deep blue green dark green gradient
of sky to river and the stillness surrounding the rumbling rush and the smell of pine needles

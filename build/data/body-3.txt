baking in the sun and the flies
skimming the water's top and trout breaching to feast on them
cliches are only cliches if you haven't lived them
all bouncing back echoes of summers passing.
I am home but not home  two years with only enough pounds for pints and fags and stuck in a studio 
every morning out here knocks a little more of the encrustations off me  two years
elsewhere

we freeze
mom yells for us kids freeze dad grabs the big
long contractor's blunt nose shovel and begins the dance
dogs bar bar barking dashing back-and-forth
ztztztztztztztztztztztztztzt it's scared the dogs freaking it out
we're scared a six-year old won't last long
with a rattler bite too little body mass to keep the poison from the heart in the forty-minute drive to town 
we're scared
